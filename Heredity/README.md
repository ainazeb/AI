This Python script simulates genetic inheritance and calculates the probabilities of individuals having specific genes and traits based on their family history. It models the genetic probabilities for a given population using a CSV file and considers various inheritance scenarios. The main steps of the program are as follows:

Loading Data: The script begins by reading data from a CSV file, which contains information about individuals, including their names, parents, and whether they exhibit a particular trait. It loads this data into a dictionary for further processing.

Initializing Probabilities: The program initializes a dictionary to store the probabilities of each individual having 0, 1, or 2 copies of a gene, and the probability of having the trait (True or False).

Iterating Over Possible Scenarios: The script iterates over all possible combinations of individuals who may have the trait and all possible gene combinations (0, 1, or 2 copies of a gene). For each combination:

It checks whether the combination is consistent with known information about the traits and parent-child relationships in the data.
It then calculates the joint probability of this combination, considering the genetic inheritance model and mutation rates.
Joint Probability Calculation: For each possible combination of genes and traits, the program calculates the joint probability based on:

The probability of inheriting a certain number of genes from the parents (taking into account mutation rates).
The probability of having the trait based on the number of genes.
Updating Probabilities: As it calculates probabilities for different gene-trait combinations, it updates the gene and trait probability distributions for each individual.

Normalizing Probabilities: After all combinations are evaluated, the script normalizes the probabilities so that the sum of the probabilities for each individual’s genes and traits equals 1.

Output: Finally, the program prints the calculated probabilities for each individual’s gene count (0, 1, or 2) and their likelihood of having the trait (True or False).

This model takes into account the genetic relationships between parents and children, and it uses a mutation rate to simulate genetic variation. The final results are normalized and displayed, providing a probabilistic view of the genetic makeup and trait expression in the population. This approach is useful for studying inheritance patterns in genetics.
